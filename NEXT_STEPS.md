# NEXT_STEPS

Prepared after the auth-screen polish on branch `multi-user`. Read this before the next step.

## Status

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Task 1 — verify polish spec | **Done.** Every spec item is present in the code. Nothing was missing, so no code changed. |
| Task 2 — safety checks | **Done, with 2 failures** (see Known issues). |
| Task 3 — commit and push | **Done.** `multi-user` is pushed. **Not** merged to `main`, **not** deployed to live. |
| Task 5 — this file | **Done.** |

## Current branch + last commit

- Branch: `multi-user`, tracking `origin/multi-user`, pushed.
- Last commit: `f33651a` — `style(ui): restyle the sign-in screen to the 45% centred column`.
- `main` is untouched and was **not** pushed.
- `pytest`: **192 passed, 15 skipped**. Staging suite: **15 passed**.

## Staging URL (iPhone, same Wi-Fi)

```
http://192.168.1.6:8765/
```

If the Mac's address has changed, run `ipconfig getifaddr en0`, or restart the server and read the URL
it prints: `./.venv/bin/python scripts/serve_staging.py`. Stop it with Ctrl-C (or
`lsof -nP -iTCP:8765 -sTCP:LISTEN -t | xargs kill`). This is the **staging** project only.

Test accounts: `duits-staging-a@example.com` and `duits-staging-b@example.com`. The password is
`STAGING_TEST_PASSWORD` in `.env.staging`. A owns 21 rows, B owns 4.

## 1. What changed

The polish itself is commit `f33651a`. No files changed in this verification session.

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `app/static/index.html` | The auth screens: 45% centred column, `min-height: 100dvh`, `safe center`, 340px column, and the full size set (logo 72/16, title 24/700, labels 12, inputs 48/12/16px, Sign in 48/24/17px, Forgot 15px, note 13px clamped to 2 lines). |
| `tests/test_page_auth.py` | Pins for the layout, every size and gap, the keyboard behaviour and the kept iOS rules. |
| `README.md` | The sign-in paragraph rewritten for the new layout and its scrolling behaviour. |

## 2. What passed / failed in the safety checks

### Passed

- **`/health`** → 200.
- **Sign in** with a correct password → 200, access token issued.
- **Wrong password** → 400 `Invalid login credentials`. No session created, button re-enabled, user stays
  on the sign-in screen. The same message is returned for an unknown address, so sign-in does not leak
  which accounts exist.
- **Set password** → `PUT /auth/v1/user` returns 200; the new password then signs in (200) and the old one
  is rejected (400); restored afterwards. The screen shows the confirm field, locks the email (the link
  already proved identity) and **clears the token out of the URL**.
- **Secrets.** 77 tracked files scanned against the real values of `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`,
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `STAGING_TEST_PASSWORD`: **no hits**.
  None of them appear in `index.html`. `.env` and `.env.staging` are untracked and gitignored.
  The publishable key is injected at serve time, never stored in the page source.
- **RLS and isolation** — 15/15 staging tests with two real accounts: cross-user list/read/patch/delete
  and receipt URLs all answer 404, dedupe is per owner, creates stamp the caller, and RLS is enforced
  through PostgREST **and** Storage (B cannot read A's receipt object).
- **No sign-up in the UI.** The page has no registration screen and never calls `/auth/v1/signup`.

### Failed / gaps

1. **Forgot password does not deliver.** Supabase answers `400 Email address "…" is invalid` for both
   existing test accounts, while unknown addresses return `200`. Two consequences:
   - **Reset emails never arrive**, so the "Forgot password" flow cannot complete today.
   - **Account enumeration at the Supabase level**: the status code differs for a known and an unknown
     address. Our UI hides this behind one message, but the API itself leaks it.
   The likely cause is the project's email provider rejecting `example.com` recipients. This is a Supabase
   setting, not app code.
2. **Sign-up is not invite-only at the Supabase level.** `disable_signup` is **false**, and
   `/auth/v1/signup` accepts registrations — a weak password returns
   `422 Password should be at least 6 characters` rather than "signups not allowed". Anyone holding the
   publishable key can create an account. The app has no sign-up UI, so the path is only the raw endpoint.

Both are Supabase project settings and need the dashboard. They are on the cutover checklist below.

## 3. Phone test checklist

Open `http://192.168.1.6:8765/` in Safari.

**Sign-in screen**
- [ ] Splash shows, then hands over to the sign-in screen.
- [ ] The block sits around the middle, slightly above centre, with the logo and title clear of the status bar.
- [ ] Tap Email: the field scrolls to the middle of the visible area after the keyboard opens. No page jump.
- [ ] The keyboard's return key shows **Next** on Email and **Go** on Password.
- [ ] Tap Password: it scrolls into view. The title stays reachable (scroll up to see it).
- [ ] Enter a wrong password: an error appears, the button works again, no data is shown.
- [ ] Sign in correctly: you land on Home with your own rows.
- [ ] Fold the keyboard away (blur): the screen scrolls back to the top and the logo and title return.
- [ ] Dark mode: switch in iOS Settings → Display, reload. The screen follows, no white flash on launch.
- [ ] "Forgot password?" opens the Reset view; "Back to sign in" returns.

**After sign-in**
- [ ] Home shows only your rows. Switch month with the pill.
- [ ] Transactions: search, filter, tap a row to open detail, edit it, delete it.
- [ ] Insights: Week / Month, the donut and the highlights.
- [ ] Settings shows your email and **Sign out**.
- [ ] Sign out: the login screen returns and no rows are visible behind it. Press Back: still no data.

**Transactions**
- [ ] Add a text transaction from the `+` sheet (Smart Entry) and confirm the row appears.
- [ ] Scan a receipt (camera or photo roll) and confirm the toast and the row.
- [ ] Open a row with a receipt and confirm the photo loads.

**Keyboard / layout**
- [ ] With the keyboard open on the sign-in screen, everything is reachable by scrolling and nothing is
      clipped under the status bar.
- [ ] No zoom when focusing any field (16px floor).
- [ ] No sideways scroll anywhere.

## 4. Cutover checklist (going live)

**Before anything is written to live.** Nothing below has been run. `docs/migration-runbook.md` has the
full detail; this is the summary.

**A. Configuration (Supabase dashboard, live project `viorpltdkpexswvofeul`)**
- [ ] **Close sign-up**: Authentication → Providers → Email → "Allow new users to sign up" = off. Then
      verify `POST /auth/v1/signup` is refused. (Currently open — see Known issues.)
- [ ] **Fix the email sender** so invite and reset links actually send, and confirm a reset link arrives.
- [ ] Add the live URL to **Redirect URLs** (and the LAN URL if you test from a phone):
      `https://duits-money-tracking.onrender.com/`.
- [ ] Verify the model IDs in `config.py` / `.env.example` against Anthropic's docs.

**B. Environment variables (Render dashboard)**
- [ ] `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `API_KEY`
- [ ] `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] `ALLOW_LEGACY_API_KEY=true` and `LEGACY_USER_ID=<your auth.users id>` — only while the iOS Shortcut
      still uses the shared key. Remove both once personal access tokens exist.
- [ ] Check `PORT` in the dashboard. The `Dockerfile` defaults to `8000`; Render's default is `10000`.
      **Do not change the Dockerfile default** — set `PORT` in the dashboard instead.

**C. Database (order matters)**
- [ ] Take a fresh backup: dashboard backup **and** `pg_dump --data-only --table=public.transactions`.
- [ ] Back up the receipts bucket: `./.venv/bin/python scripts/backup_receipts.py` (read-only; refuses to
      overwrite an existing folder).
- [ ] Record the baseline counts with `scripts/audit_live.py` (read-only).
- [ ] Run `migrations/0002_multi_user.up.sql` in the live SQL editor, preceded by
      `select set_config('app.owner_id', '<your auth.users id>', false);` **in the same run**.
      - This is the step that assigns **all existing rows to your user id** (the backfill). That is the
        "existing data -> my user" step. Review the row count before and after.
- [ ] Verify with `migrations/staging/verify_after_up.sql` (read-only). Expect: rows without owner = 0,
      per-owner unique constraints, RLS on, 4 transaction policies, 3 storage policies.
- [ ] Move the receipt objects: `scripts/migrate_receipts.py --env-file .env --project-ref
      viorpltdkpexswvofeul --allow-live` (dry run first, then `--apply`, then dry run again to confirm
      `legacy_rows: 0`).

**D. Deploy**
- [ ] Merge `multi-user` to `main` when you are ready (Render auto-deploys from `main`).
- [ ] Smoke test: `/health` 200, `/` 200 with `no-store`, sign in on the phone, one scan, one edit.
- [ ] Re-check the **Build** row in Settings matches the deployed commit.
- [ ] Keep `migrations/0002_saved_constraints` until the rollback window is closed, then drop it.

**E. Rollback plan**
- [ ] Code: redeploy the previous commit on `main`. The old code never reads `user_id`, so it works with
      the restored schema.
- [ ] Schema: run `migrations/0002_multi_user.down.sql`. It drops the policies, `api_tokens` and the new
      indexes, restores the **original** global unique constraints from the snapshot, and drops `user_id`.
      Rows are kept. It **refuses to run** if two owners share a hash, and changes nothing in that case.
- [ ] Receipts do not need to be moved back: each row's `receipt_path` is the source of truth.
- [ ] Re-running the up migration after a rollback is supported and was rehearsed.

## 5. Known issues

1. **Forgot-password emails do not send** for the staging accounts (Supabase: `400 Email address is
   invalid`). The UI is correct; the delivery is not. Also leaks account existence by status code.
2. **Public sign-up is open** on the Supabase project (`disable_signup: false`). The app has no sign-up
   UI, but the raw endpoint accepts registrations. Must be closed before live.
3. **Not verified on a real iPhone.** Everything was checked in desktop Chrome. Notably unverified:
   whether `100dvh` shrinks when the iOS keyboard opens (the design assumes the box can scroll), whether
   `justify-content: safe center` is supported in Safari (the plain `center` fallback would let the title
   clip above the box on overflow), `scrollIntoView` inside a fixed scroll container, real safe-area
   insets, and focus zoom at exactly 16px.
4. **`PORT` ambiguity on Render.** The `Dockerfile` defaults to `8000`; Render's default is `10000`.
   Confirm the dashboard value before deploying.
5. **The form is taller than the keyboard strip** on a small phone (456px of content against 300px at
   375×667), so it scrolls rather than fitting in one glance. Every control is reachable.
6. **The Build stamp is injected per request** from `RENDER_GIT_COMMIT`, or `dev` locally. No manual bump
   is needed. Opening `index.html` from disk shows the raw `{{BUILD}}`.
7. **`image_hash` exists in the live table but not in `schema.sql`** — a fresh database built from the repo
   would not match production. `migrations/0002` depends on it existing.
